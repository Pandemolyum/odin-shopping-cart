# odin-shopping-cart

A mock shop page allowing the user to select products from the shop and view them in a cart. [Click here](https://odin-shopping-cart-3ko.pages.dev/shop) to see the project in its deployed state.

The project is built using React and Typescript. It was my first introduction to TypeScript. It additionally makes use of routing for handling page links seamlessly. Vitest was used to validate user input.

Thanks to [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs) for providing the store items data.
